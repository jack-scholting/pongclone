# PongClone #

Normal Gameplay

![normal](/../resources/pong_ss.PNG?raw=true)

## Overview ##

This is a very simple clone of the popular game Pong. I created it as a way to learn a little about the Pygame library.

## Installation ##

Install Python27 and Pygame, then run pong_clone.py.

## Usage ##

The left player uses Q/A keys for UP/DOWN. The right player uses the UP Arrow/Down Arrow for UP/DOWN.

## Credits ##

I pulled from a few pygame tutorials to get me going but none heavily/exclusively.
